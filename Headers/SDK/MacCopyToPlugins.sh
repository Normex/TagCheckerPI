#
# This script runs in the last build phase of each plug-in target.
# It copies a symbolic link to the plug-in package into the 
# Acrobat plug-ins directory.
# The Acrobat plug-ins directory is set to the default install 
# location for Acrobat in the Environment.xcconfig file.
#
# If you update this file you must clean your target in order to
# read the script updates
#
# Commented out below is the replacement script to make a copy of
# the plug-in itself rather than a symlink
#
# IMPORTANT:
# If you try to launch Acrobat with an orphan plug-in symlink in its 
# plug-in directory, it will crash.
# This can occur if you clean your target, which will delete your plug-in 
# package from your BuildResults tree, but will *NOT* delete the symlink 
# copied by this script to the actual Acrobat plug-ins folder.
# It can also occur if you move or delete the original.
#
# *********************************************************************

# The script can be used to copy your plugin in the acrobat plugins folder
# Please specify the correct path for the Acrobat plugins folder in the ../MacSDKConfigurations/Environment.xcconfig
# Please change the permissions of the acrobat plugins folder.
# Uncomment the commands to use the script.
